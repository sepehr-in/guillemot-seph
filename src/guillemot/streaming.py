"""Running the agent with something to watch while it works.

`agent.run` returns only once the whole run is over, which on a local model can be
several minutes of silence — indistinguishable from a hang. Iterating the run instead
gives access to the parts as the model streams them, so its reasoning can be shown as
it arrives, along with how full the context window is getting.

Only `run_and_show` is meant to be called from outside; everything else here is about
how the terminal looks.
